This is a responsive landing page for a fictional company called "Interactive ART," which specializes in creating new-generation websites for businesses and creative works. The page is designed to showcase the company's services, client testimonials, portfolio, and a call-to-action section. It's built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure it's dynamic, mobile-friendly (responsive), and engaging.
